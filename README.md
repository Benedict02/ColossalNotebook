## FAQ

#### What is the purpose of this project?

For us(the creators), this project is a means to sharpen our knowledge and abilities, especially in programming & academics.

For users, this project is used to compound notes, summaries and practice questions from the internet and/or school for your convenience in obtaining magna cumlaude or above(depends on your dedication and hard work).

We wish to integrate this project with canitutor in the future. Providing study materials that can be easily distributed and accessed (at least compared to whatsapp).
