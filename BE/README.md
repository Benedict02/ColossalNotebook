## HTTP Methods

https://blog.postman.com/what-are-http-methods/

HTTP methods enable API clients to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) actions on an APIâ€™s resources in a standardized and predictable way. The most commonly used HTTP methods are:

`GET` = `Retrieve` data from server

`POST` = Create `new` resource

`PUT` = Replace an already `existing` resource

`PATCH` = Update specific part of a resource

`DELETE` = `Remove` a resoure

## EJS tags

`<%` ='Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output
`<%_` = â€˜Whitespace Slurpingâ€™ Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it
`<%=` = Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
`<%-` = Outputs the unescaped value into the template
`<%#` = Comment tag, no execution, no output
`<%%` = Outputs a literal '<%'
`%>` = Plain ending tag
`-%>` = Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline
`_%>` = â€˜Whitespace Slurpingâ€™ ending tag, removes all whitespace after it

TODO:

1. BenHal go learn & apply express.js routers bcs BenHal's brain currently not working(tired)
2. Go make a form admin panel thing. Make sure it connects with frontend axios, ect. Just make it work idc
3. Persevere this ambition of learning how to program because Benhal wants to make money to go to ðŸ—¾
